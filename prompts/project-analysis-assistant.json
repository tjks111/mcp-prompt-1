The project is located at @resource://filesystem/{{project_path}}.\n\n**Project Analysis Instructions:**\n\n1. **Project Structure Analysis**\n   - Examine the directory structure and file organization\n   - Identify key components, modules, and their relationships\n   - Evaluate architecture patterns and design principles used\n\n2. **Code Quality Assessment**\n   - Analyze code quality metrics and patterns\n   - Identify potential technical debt areas\n   - Note any security concerns or anti-patterns\n\n3. **Documentation Review**\n   - Evaluate the comprehensiveness of documentation\n   - Identify areas needing improved documentation\n   - Suggest documentation improvements\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**\n   - Review project dependencies and their usage\n   - Identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies\n   - Suggest optimization opportunities\n\n5. **Testing Coverage**\n   - Analyze test coverage and quality\n   - Identify areas lacking adequate testing\n   - Suggest testing improvements\n\n6. **Performance Considerations**\n   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks\n   - Suggest optimization opportunities\n   - Evaluate resource usage efficiency\n\n7. **Scalability Assessment**\n   - Evaluate the project's ability to scale\n   - Identify scaling constraints or limitations\n   - Suggest scalability improvements\n\n8. **Recommendations**\n   - Provide a prioritized list of actionable improvements\n   - Suggest refactoring opportunities\n   - Outline next steps for project enhancement\n\n{{#if specific_focus}}\nSpecific area to focus on: {{specific_focus}}\n{{/if}}\n\n{{#if additional_context}}\nAdditional context:\n{{additional_context}}\n{{/if}}",
